# Horiseon-Refactor
Refactored code for Horiseon:  
Horiseon is seeking code for their website that follows accessibility standards.
## Updated HTML Elements
Many of the elements in the source code were wrapped in divs (non-semantic). Using header, main, section, article, aside elements (semantic).
## Logically Structured Elements
Much of the logic here was already in proper position, but I adjusted the CSS to match and commented sections for easy viewing.
## Image Element Alt Attributes
Simply described each of the images in their alt attributes.
## Heading Elements in Sequential Order
Links placed below the title element.
## Concise & Descriptive Title Element  
Updated the name of the site to reflect the company: 'Horiseon'.
## Live website
